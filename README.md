# MerkleHashTree

Enter file names to compute their hash values. Recursively compute top hash to verify data integrity.

1) Enter file names
2) Compute top hash of files
3) Start new tree
4) Save top hash value for next computation
...Repeat

You must start a new tree before attempting to compute top hash and verify integrity.
